It is not enough to comply with the ABI.",

      "message": "Fixed up the ones in scale_neon64.cc.\n\nI have a few changes locally to move some initial row_neon64.cc kernels across to mostly intrinsics (with a couple of fallbacks to inline-asm where the compiler currently does a poor job) which are showing good speedups. I\u0027ll raise a bug ticket to track that at some point in the next few days.\n\nFor the kernels that we can\u0027t currently move across to intrinsics, we could be a lot more specific about what memory is being accessed by moving the loop control out of the inline asm and using memory asm constraints (e.g. \"m\" rather than \"r\" etc).\n\nWhat do you think about this?",
