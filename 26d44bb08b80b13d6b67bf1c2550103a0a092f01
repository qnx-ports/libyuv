See how NEON is disabled\nunit_test.cc:  if (TestEnv(\"LIBYUV_DISABLE_NEON\")) {\nThen run the benchmark again with I8MM or NEONDOT disabled to compare performance to NEON to ensure the I8MM is working well.\nOn linux/android I would use perf or simpleperf to record/report on a benchmark to ensure the expected row function is used.",
